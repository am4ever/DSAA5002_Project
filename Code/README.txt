There are five things to note:

1. All the code for Task1 can be run directly on Colab, and additional packages are all auto-installed via command line code.

2. The code for Task1 Q1 is divided into 5 is the complete data is divided into 5 segments to run, as a way to reduce the running time. The code in Odd_Jobs.ipynb was combined after the run was completed.

3.Task2 code in the installation of the local Neo4j Desktop can be run directly in the Jupyter Notebook, the required additional packages have been automatically installed through the command line code.

4. The path of imported data files in each code file may need to be adjusted to a new path, all data files can be found in the Data folder of the previous level.

5.The codes in the Other_Codes folder is just files used to test various methods midway through the process and can be run directly in Colab or Kaggle.

For codes' data requirements:

1. For all Task1_Q1 code, it needs news_data.xlsx and A_share_list.json data files and outputs Task_part1-x.xlsx file (x belongs to 1 to 5). And use Odd_Jobs.ipynb collection into Task_part1.xlsx.

2. For Task1_Q2 code, it needs labelnews.xlsx, Task_part1.xlsx two files, and output Task1.xlsx file.

3. For Task2_Q3, it needs al files under the data folder's Knowledge Graph folder.

4. For Task2_Q4, its need A_share_list.json, Task1.xlsx with the KnowledgeGraph of Task2_Q3.
